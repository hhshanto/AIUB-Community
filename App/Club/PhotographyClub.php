          <font size="3"color="black">A Picture says a thousand words.The idea that a picture can convey what might take to express was voiced many years ago and it still holds true. A photographerâ€™s strength is his ability to record the reality accurately. He is the witness of events. AIUB Photography Club is one of the most active clubs of AIUB. AIUBPC has young and talented photographers in their club who covers all the programs of AIUB. 
          </font>
          <p></p>
          <font size="3"color="black">A feeling of missing something gave birth to an idea and with the permission of the authorities it turned into reality. AIUB Photography Club has started its journey on 24th December, 2005 by a group of students who was an admirer of photography and had some knowledge; found some people of same interest in the university. Though they shared same kind of interest, they didn't have the opportunity to go any further. Especially when they looked up to other private universities they started to feel the lacking of a club and they proposed the authorities about their idea and succeed in their second try. AIUB Photography was called APC from 2005 to 2011. But From 2011 it has been renamed as AIUBPC.</font>
          <p></p>

          <font size="3"color="black">AIUB Photography Club (AIUB PC) is a platform which encourages the students of AIUB to use their creative skills, share their knowledge and participate in technical discussion and most of all present their collective photographs through initiatives like Photography workshops, Photography outdoors, Exhibitions and lots more.</font> 

          <p></p>

          
         <font size="3"color="black">AIUB Photography Club has already organized Intra-AIUB Photography Exhibition 2011 for the first time outside the campus and achieved a big response.</font> 

         <p></p>


         <font size="3"color="black">AIUB Photography Club works to improve the basic skills of photography. We believe that practice and hard work can make anything awesome. We have started our journey and hopefully we will be successful.</font>
